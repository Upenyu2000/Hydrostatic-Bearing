# Hydrostatic-Bearing
 The problem involves designing hydrostatic thrust bearings with the primary goal of minimizing operational power loss when subjected to axial loads. The design parameters affecting power loss include flow rate (Q), recess radius (R0), bearing step radius (R), and fluid viscosity (Î¼). Hydrostatic bearings employ pressurized fluid to create a thin film separating moving and stationary surfaces, reducing friction and wear while offering high stiffness and load capacity. The design evaluation compares the effectiveness of random search and simulated annealing algorithms. This summary could be included in a README file on GitHub for a project related to hydrostatic thrust bearing design optimization.
